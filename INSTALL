log_functions Install
=====================

To install log_functions, you can untar the log_functions tarball
anywhere you want.

You'll need to compile it. There are two ways to do that:

* In the PostgreSQL source code directory, inside the contrib sub-directory

  Put the log_functions source directory inside the contrib subdirectory
  of PostgreSQL.
  Do "make", then "make install"

* Using pgxs

  Do "make USE_PGXS=1", then "make USE_PGXS=1 install"

Once it's installed, you'll need to configure PostgreSQL to make use of it:

* shared_preload_libraries='log_functions'
* custom_variable_classes

There are five optional parameters that allow you to select which logs you want:

* log_functions.log_declare
* log_functions.log_function_begin
* log_functions.log_function_end
* log_functions.log_statement_begin
* log_functions.log_statement_end

Once the configuration is done, restart PostgreSQL.

You can also decide to use it only from time to time. If you want to do that,
you don't need to configure PostgreSQL. When you want to use it, simply execute
the following SQL statement:

  LOAD 'log_functions';

Then, you will be able to set the five optional parameters.
